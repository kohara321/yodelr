FullStack review app - project

The focus of this project is building a Ruby API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.

Requirements
For this project, you must:

Use Active Record to interact with a database.
Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
create and read actions for both models
full CRUD capability for one of the models
Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.

As a user, I can see details of records from a backend database.
As a user, I can place a persisting review on related record.
As a user, I can add or delete new records.
